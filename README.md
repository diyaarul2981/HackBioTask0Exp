HackBio internship 2021 team Hooke

HackBio is a virtual internship for life scientists, students, instructors and early career researcher. This is a 5-weeks virtual research internship that is practice oriented and focused on equipping scientists globally with advanced bioinformatics and computational biology skills. This is a great opportunity for learning and sharing. At the end of the inernship the participants will be equiped with advanced bioinformatic skills to work as an independent project leader. People/participants can join as a intern for learning and as a mentor for sharing the knowledge.
The academic team ofHackBio organisers consist of instructors and mentors. The listed instructors are [Ambrose O.
